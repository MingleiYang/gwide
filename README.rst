ploting of genome-wide plots pyCRAC downstream tool

pyPiecharts_from_hittables.py, compareHittables.py and countHittables.py working with pyReadCounter.py output files *hittable_reads.txt

compareHittables.py - to calculate Pearson, Spearman and Kendall corelation coefficients between hittables - as many as you want.
ruffusCalculatePearsonCoefficient.py - runs compareHittables.py but work directly on *.novo files

ruffusCreateConcat.py - creates *.concat file from *.novo files taking name from name.novo as experiment name
gwidePlot.py - generates genome-wide plots from *.concat files
